javascript is synchronous(ek ke baad ek)
single threaded lang(meaning slow)

execution context
execute one line of code at a time
each operation wiats for last to complete before executing
(call stack, memory heap)

blocking code vs non blocking code
blocking code - blocks flow of program , read file sync(tm apna kaam roko jb tk mai file access krke lata hun)

non-blocking - doesn't block execution, read file async(tm apna kaam krte rho mai file access krke le aaunga)
